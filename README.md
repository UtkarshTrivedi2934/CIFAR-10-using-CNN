# CIFAR-10-using-CNN
CIFAR-10, a dataset comprising 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, is commonly employed to assess the performance of image classification models. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven particularly effective in handling image data due to their ability to learn hierarchical features directly from pixels.
