# CIFAR-10-using-CNN
CIFAR-10, a dataset comprising 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, is commonly employed to assess the performance of image classification models. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven particularly effective in handling image data due to their ability to learn hierarchical features directly from pixels. 

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for CIFAR-10 involve the following key steps:

Input Layer: The input layer of the CNN processes the 32x32 color images, typically with three color channels (red, green, and blue).

Convolutional Layers: Convolutional layers consist of filters or kernels that convolve across the input image to detect spatial patterns and features. These layers capture low-level features like edges, textures, and colors.

Activation Functions: Non-linear activation functions, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), are applied after convolutional layers to introduce non-linearity and enable the network to learn complex relationships.

Pooling Layers: Pooling layers, often using max pooling, downsample the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, reducing the computational load and focusing on the most essential information.

Flattening: After several convolutional and pooling layers, the feature maps are flattened into a one-dimensional vector, preparing the data for the fully connected layers.

Fully Connected Layers: Fully connected layers process the flattened feature vector, learning high-level representations and making the final classification decisions.

Output Layer: The output layer produces a probability distribution over the 10 classes, with each node representing the likelihood of the input image belonging to a specific class. The softmax activation function is commonly used in this layer.

Loss Function and Optimization: The model is trained by minimizing a suitable loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss) using optimization techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants.

Training and Evaluation: The CNN is trained on the CIFAR-10 training set and evaluated on the separate test set. The accuracy and other performance metrics are used to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying unseen images.
